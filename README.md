ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gabriel! 
I'm currently studying Economic Sciences and have a strong passion for innovation and technology. 
I love diving into data with R and am excited to be expanding my skills in Python. 
Welcome to my GitHub, where I explore the intersection of economics, programming, and cutting-edge tech. 
Let's connect and innovate together!
